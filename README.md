# Notice, for people who got in trouble at school and owners of games.

For the troublemakers, It ain't my problem if you get caught using this at school. Me, and the rest of the dev's are not responsible for any incidents occurring with the use of this site. So, the next time someone comes to me or any of the other dev's with a situation where they were caught using this site, or any variations including legacy versions, we will take it by a grain of salt.

For game owners, if you are the owner of any games, I will take them down if you ask me via the issues template. Please don't take my site down, I respond quickly to DMCA request using that template.
